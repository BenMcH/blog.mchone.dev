# blog.mchone.dev

Welcome to my blog! Er, welcome to my blog's source code!
In this repo, you'll find all of the magic that powers https://blog.mchone.dev.

This site uses Gatsby to generate a blog with the [Novela theme](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela)

You may find future blog posts in other branches :shushing_face:

Running the site locally involves installing dependencies with `yarn` and then running with `yarn dev`.
Building the site is done with `yarn build` and is output to the `public` folder.
